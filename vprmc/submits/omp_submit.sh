# all.q contains 8 slots for every node. testqueue.q contains 1 slot for every queue and therefore should be

# OpenMPI is current parallel environment for nodes without IB. Do not change unless you use a different MPI
# <num> specifies how many processors in total to request. It's suggested use 12*integer processors here. 
# If the queue is testqueue, specify the number of nodes you want to use instead of cores.

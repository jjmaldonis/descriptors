===========

1. VP-RMC
    Syntax is:  ./rmc jobid vp_paramfile modelfile
    There is a testing vp_paramfile in src/temp.txt for 1250 atoms
    A modified version of that containing only 90% of the top VP is in src/temp2.txt
    I just added energy to the cost function again. !Currently does not include the energy in the cost function.
